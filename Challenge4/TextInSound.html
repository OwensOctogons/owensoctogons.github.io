    <p>Good job soldier, I knew you could crack that code, you may be the chosen one after all.. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, we have here a image that Owen was caught sending to one of his associates. It was sent with the message “RGB is all you need” here our spies quickly developed <a href="https://www.tuxpi.com/photo-effects/colorswap">this tool for you to use as well</a>. Good luck again soldier. Enter your keyword same as the last it should be three words put em together like this.
