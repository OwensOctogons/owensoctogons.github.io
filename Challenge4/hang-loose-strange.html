    <p>Almost there soldier. We need to get into 
        Owen’s personal email for this keyword, 
        but he has hidden it somewhere on this website. 
        I need you to do some poking for me find the email and 
        email it for me. Anything will do. Now right click, press 
        "Inspect element" and get started! ("May also be "inspect") 
        once you find it.. Send him an email pretending to be his friend 
        maybe 
        he will give you the super secret keyword..</p>
