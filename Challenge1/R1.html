You continue chuckling down the right path, or should I say the not wrong path. Haha, now i'm chuckling. See what you’ve done. You’re ruining my storytelling with your stupid jokes. Ahem. As you continue down the right- ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. The right.. Hahaha as in- Not wrong, hahahahahahahahaha That’s a good one. I'm actually proud of you for that one as stupid as it is. hahahahahahahahaha Look at what you did, I can't even focus enough to put a picture here.
