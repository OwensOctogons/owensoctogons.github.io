		You slowly make your way into the cave walking deeper and deeper until you can no longer see the light of the entrance you came through. The musty smell of moist cave walls permeates your nose and the chill of the cave air slowly starts to make you shiver. As you begin to think about turning back you see a light ahead. Making your way towards the light you are greeted by a man sitting next to a fire. He beckons to a seat next to him.    </p>
