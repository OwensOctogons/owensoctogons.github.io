You say the only phrase that you learned in sign language class “Shut up about frogs and point me in the right direction” wow. That came in handy. You tell the man in sign language and he gets angry, when he starts to glow and transform, his body gets slimier and greener, and his feet and hands begin to get more webbed, until he morphs into a human-frog hybrid creature. He leaps at you as you start to run away but his leap is too strong. He lands on you. “You are a bad froggy” he says as you begin to shrink. “And bad froggies get punished.” he picks up your shrunken form.. But wait you haven’t just shrunk you look at your hands and see the webbed hands of a frog, this man has turned you into a frog. He begins to lower you in his mouth as everything goes black.
