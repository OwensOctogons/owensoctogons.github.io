      Welcome adventurer, I'm glad to see you could make it! Let me take you through an adventure, and adventure of spooks and scares, romance and tragedy, love and war, stock images and myself in strange costumes, dungeons and Perhaps.. Dragons. Or perhaps there will be none of that, you will just have to see.
