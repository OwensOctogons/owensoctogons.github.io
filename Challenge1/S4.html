      You sit next to the man on a wide piece of rock, he begins talking about frogs for hours. You know nothing of frogs. Most of what this man says falls on deaf ears. But you do catch one fact that you might bring back to your family. “Frogs were the first land animals with vocal cords. Male frogs have vocal sacs—pouches of skin that fill with air. These balloons resonate sounds like a megaphone, and some frog sounds can be heard from a mile away.” That’s a pretty cool frog fact you think to yourself. Maybe the time sitting here with this man wasn’t wasted after all. The man pauses as you think to yourself about that frog fact, he looks at you expectantly like he just asked you a question and wants you to answer.. Shoot. You were thinking about vocal sacs and not listening..
