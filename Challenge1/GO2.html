		You look weirdly at this old man and proceed to walk further into the cave but the cave keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger until finally the cave stops growing. You stop for a second to recollect yourself in this cave now 10 times the size you feel an itch on your head and reach to scratch it, but it feels slimy. You recoil in fear and look at your hand, but what is there is not a hand.. Or at least a human one.. You look at your webbed fingers and leap backwards, but not a normal leap, a frog leap. You find a cave puddle and look into it. You are a frog, you see the man start to approach you. You try to run but aren’t used to your new frog body, the man catches you and smiles, “Good froggies don’t run.” You feel compelled to comply, you never want to run again, you will follow this man wherever he goes. The man places you inside a bucket with seemingly hundreds more frogs all staring at you excited at the new friend that just appeared.    </p>
