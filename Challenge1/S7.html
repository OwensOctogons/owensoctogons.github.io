The man continues to stare at you expectantly. Wait. He can’t hear you, he seems to be deaf. Now the irony is hitting you, you skipped your sign language classes today to go exploring this cave, so far you have only learned on phrase “Shut up about frogs and point me in the right direction” what a stupid decision it was to skip today, today you were going to learn how to ask “Can you repeat the question, I was entranced by vocal sacs” which is why you skipped because why would anybody ever use that statement, is this devine punishment for doing that? No matter, you have to make a decision quickly, the man is staring at you
