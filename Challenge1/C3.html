      You approach a waiter, and in the most fake french accent you have ever heard he says “Care for some hors d'oeuvres?” Why not.. You grab one of the snacks on the tray and take a bite as the flavour explodes in your mouth, what is this? It is the best thing you have ever tasted. You greedily reach up and grab another, and another until the waiter's tray is empty. He sits there with a smile and offers you a drink in his goofy ass french accent. You accept and down the sweetest red wine your lips have ever tasted. Your brain fills with such pleasure all you want to do is stay here and experience this casino forever. You experience the need to sit down at one of the slot machines and just keep spinning.
