Whatever’s not right is left! Seemingly nothing can go wrong with this decision. You begin to walk down the left path wondering if you could have made a better choice. This path goes on forever and ever and ever and ever and ever… you get the jist. You just keep walking and walking until you start to collapse, it’s been quite a number of hours since you have last eaten or drank anything. You lay there on the cold, dank cave floor as your stomach growls for attention. Your vision starts to go black as you pass out. You wake up in something squishy.. a.. bed? Who’s bed is this? You begin to panic when you smell food, fresh food cooking. You cautiously get up. “Ah, you’re awake” a gruff voice says from the shadows, “Come, have a seat, have a seat.” Not knowing any better you make your way forward to see an old man with long white hair and a long white beard wearing a pointy wizards hat and a robe. “Please, i found you collapsed in the cave down the left path, you must have missed the sign beside the path that said ‘very long path ahead, bring snacks’, because I didn’t find any on you! Luckily I was there. I brought you back to my abode a little farther down said left path, here, eat something.” The spread in front of you was magnificent, you couldn’t help yourself from eating until you were stuffed. Finally after filling your belly, you work up the courage to ask this man a question
