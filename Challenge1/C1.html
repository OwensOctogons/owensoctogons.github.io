      You know what they say. “Keep doing the most familiar thing if you hate change!” You continue going the exact way you started on, ignoring the left and right paths, this feels right, this feels safe. This feels exactly where you need to be! There’s a skip in your step as you walk down the centre path, and almost immediately your choice rewards you, after only 5 minutes of walking you walk into a room in the cave covered in bright lights, the floors are velvet you can hardly believe they fit this all in a cave. When all the sudden it dawns on you. This is a casino, waiters walk the floor with unlimited drinks and snacks, and slot machines, all the slot machines you could ask for. There is a large neon sign “Dionysis Palace” and under that sign you see a big red button. You turn around and seemingly the cave is gone, all you can see as far as you can see are slot machines, lights and waiters.
