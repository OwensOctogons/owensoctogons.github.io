        Today we have intercepted one of Owen’s phone calls but it seems like some kind of code.. He seems to be streaming about some kind of cereal. We get some beeps but we can’t seem to decipher it. We need your help, soldier, take this handy tool our very own spies made up. <a href="https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/">Access it here</a> And download this audio. Once you find it, meet me at the next page. owensoctogons.github.io/Challenge4/______.html  <strong>(Maybe turn down your volume a little its not bad but there is a louder part)</strong></p>
