The man looks horrified, offended even that you seemingly agreed to whatever he said. He gets up off the rock and starts backing away from you still looking at you with that horrified expression on his face. You see a bucket filled with frogs that was seated next to the man, every single frog in that bucket is looking at you, with the same expression on their little froggy faces. There may be hundreds of frogs in that bucket. Each one of them hops out to follow their master, still looking at you cautiously. After about an hour of hundreds of frogs slowly leaping out of the bucket uncomfortably staring at you they are all seemingly gone, leaving you by the fire seated on the rock where the frog man once sat - alone. You slowly get up and start walking deeper into the cave still thinking about vocal sacs when suddenly you see a trident in the road (yes a trident, which is just a three pronged fork) You must decide where to go.    </p>
