		You walk up the locket and pick it up, its golden lustre makes you think that this must be worth a lot and gives you a hope that your hard times are finally over. You run your fingers along the locket and start to open it. The open locket now sitting in your hand you look at the photo inside… It’s just a naked old man, on the other side of the locket there is a carving that says: “Made you Look”. You now see that this locket isn’t gold, it's a really shiny plastic. You put it back on the cave wall so some other poor fool can suffer whatever horrors your eyes just saw.
