      The wizard listens to your question and thinks. He then brings up a very good question in return. “Where are you going?” you… don’t actually know. You try to think back, before the cave entrance but.. Nothing. You just appeared there, like your existence just started back at that cave entrance. You stop thinking about that, it makes your head hurt. Where am I going… You try instead to dig in your mind for the answer to that question, very neatly put away in your brain, in a folder labelled “End Goal” you find it. You are trying to find the passphrase, the passphrase to give the discord bot to get points for Owen’s Octagons! Whatever that means.. You relay this newfound information to the man. “Ahh” he responds as a little smile crosses his face “What a cheeky man that Owen is. He did talk to me a while back saying that someone like you may come looking for that I had forgotten as it was such a long time ago.” He rummages around on a shelf and finds two crystal ball looking things, now it’s one of these.. But I don’t remember which. He places the ball down on the table, “here let’s try this one”
